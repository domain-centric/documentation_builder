<a id='lib-parser-link-parser-dart-link'></a>You can refer to other parts of the documentation using [Link]s.
[Link]s:
- are references between square brackets [] in [MarkdownTemplateFile]s, e.g.: [MyClass]
- can have optional or required attributes, e.g. []

The [DocumentationBuilder] will try to convert these to hyperlinks that point to an existing http uri.
The [Link] will not be replaced to a hyperlink when the uri does not exits.
