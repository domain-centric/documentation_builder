<a id='lib-parser-tag-parser-dart-tag'></a>[Tag]s are specific texts in [MarkdownTemplate]s that are replaced by the
 [DocumentationBuilder] with other information
 (e.g. by an imported Dart Documentation Comment) before the output file is written.

[Tag]s:
- are surrounded by curly brackets: {}
- start with a name: e.g.  {ImportFile&rcub;
- may have [Attribute]s after the name:
  e.g. {ImportFile path='OtherTemplateFile.mdt' title='## Other Template File'&rcub;


<a id='tag-attributes'></a>
## Tag Attributes
[Tag]s can contain [Attribute]s. These contain additional information for the [Tag].
[Attribute]s can be mandatory or optional.

The following paragraphs will explain the format of different path [Attribute]s:

<a id='project-file-path'></a>
### Project File Path
[ProjectFilePath] is a reference to a file in your source project
- The [ProjectFilePath] is always relative to root directory of the project directory.
- The [ProjectFilePath] will always be within the project directory, that is they will never contain "../".
- The [ProjectFilePath] always uses forward slashes as path separators, regardless of the host platform (also for Windows).

Example: doc/wiki/Home.md


<a id='dart-code-path'></a>
### Dart Code Path
A [DartCodePath] is a reference to a piece of your Dart source code.
This could be anything from a whole dart file to one of its members.
Format: <[DartFilePath]>|<[DartMemberPath]>
- <[DartFilePath]> (required) is a [DartFilePath] to a Dart file without dart extension, e.g. lib/my_library.dart
- |: the <[DartFilePath]> and <[DartMemberPath]> are separated with a vertical bar | when there is a [DartMemberPath].
- <[DartMemberPath]> (optional) is a dot separated path to the member inside the Dart file, e.g.
  - .constantName
  - .functionName
  - .EnumName (optionally followed by a dot and a enum value)
  - .ClassName (optionally followed by a dot and a class member such as a field name or method name)
  - .ExtensionName  (optionally followed by a dot and a extension member such as a field name or method name)

Examples:
- lib/my_library.dart
- lib/my_library.dart|myConstant
- lib/my_library.dart|myFunction
- lib/my_library.dart|MyEnum
- lib/my_library.dart|MyEnum.myValue
- lib/my_library.dart|MyClass
- lib/my_library.dart|MyClass.myFieldName
- lib/my_library.dart|MyClass.myFieldName.get
- lib/my_library.dart|MyClass.myFieldName.set
- lib/my_library.dart|MyClass.myMethod
- lib/my_library.dart|MyExtension
- lib/my_library.dart|MyExtension.myFieldName
- lib/my_library.dart|MyExtension.myFieldName.get
- lib/my_library.dart|MyExtension.myFieldName.set
- lib/my_library.dart|MyExtension.myMethod


<a id='dart-file-path'></a>
### Dart File Path
A [DartFilePath] is a [ProjectFilePath] to a dart file.
It must end with a '.dart' extension.

Example: lib/my_library.dart


<a id='dart-member-path'></a>
### Dart Member Path
A [DartMemberPath] is a dot separated path to a member inside the Dart file.
It is a part of a [DartCodePath].

Examples:
- myConstant
- myFunction
- MyEnum
- MyEnum.myValue
- MyClass
- MyClass.myFieldName
- MyClass.myFieldName.get
- MyClass.myFieldName.set
- MyClass.myMethod
- MyExtension
- MyExtension.myFieldName
- MyExtension.myFieldName.get
- MyExtension.myFieldName.set
- MyExtension.myMethod


## Tag types
The following paragraphs will explain the different tags:
