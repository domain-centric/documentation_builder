## The easy way
The simplest way to use the [documentation_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/documentation_builder) package
is to use it as a command line tool.

To install it, run `dart pub global activate documentation_builder` from the command line.

After installation you can use the following commands:
* `documentation_builder help`
  Shows available commands.
* `documentation_builder setup`
  Sets up a project to use the documentation_builder:
  * Adds build_runner as dev dependency if needed\n'
  * Adds documentation_builder as dev dependency if needed\n'
  * Adds or updates build.yaml'
  * Adds template files if needed\n'
  * Adds github publish-wiki workflow if needed';.
* `documentation_builder build`
  Generates documentation files from template files
  by starting `build_runner build`.

## The hard way: step by step  
* Read the [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/domain-centric/documentation_builder/wiki)
* Install [documentation_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/documentation_builder) developer dependencies in  in your project:
  ```
  dart pub add --dev build_runner
  dart pub add --dev documentation_builder
  ```
  [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) is a tool to run file generators like [documentation_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/documentation_builder)
* Configure the documentation_builder
Add a build.yaml file to the root of your project with the following lines (or merge lines if build.yaml file already exists):
  ```
  targets:
    $default:
      sources:
      - doc/**
      - lib/**
      - bin/**
      - web/**
      - test/**
      - pubspec.*
      - $package$
      builders:
        documentation_builder|documentation_builder:
          enabled: True
          # options:
            # input_path:
              # An expression where to find template files
              # Defaults to 'doc/template/{{filePath}}.template'
            # output_path:
              # An expression where to store the result files
              # Defaults to '{{filePath}}'
            # file_headers:
              # A map of file output suffixes and the file header template to be added (which can be null), defaults to:
           # LICENSE: null
           # LICENSE.md: null
           # .md: '[//](https://pub.dev/packages///): "# (This file was generated from: {{inputPath()}} using the documentation_builder package)"
           # .dart: "// This file was generated from: {{inputPath()}} using the documentation_builder package"
  ```
  For more information on the build.yaml file see [build_config](https://pub.dev/documentation/build_config/latest/)
* Create 'doc/template' folders in the root of your project
* Create template files in the "doc/template" folder. See [examples](https://github.com/domain-centric/documentation_builder/wiki/10-Examples)
* [Generate the documentation files](https://github.com/domain-centric/documentation_builder/wiki/08-Generating)
* [Publish the documentation files](https://github.com/domain-centric/documentation_builder/wiki/09-Publishing)
