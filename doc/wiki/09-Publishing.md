You need to publish the [GeneratedMarkdownFile]s to make them available for reading on web pages.
The following paragraphs will explain how.

### Publishing none Wiki pages
The generated documentation files will become directly available:
- on https://github.com: by committing and pushing the files to [GitHub](https://github.com) using ```git commit``` and ```git push``` commands
- on https://pub.dev: by publishing your project to [PubDev](https://pub.dev) using ```dart pub publish``` or ```flutter pub publish``` commands

### Cloning Wiki pages
Before you can publish the Wiki files to [GitHub](https://github.com), you must first clone the Wiki pages into your local project. You only have to do this the first time:
- Create a Wiki page on your github project:
  - Open in browser: ```https://github.com/<user_name>/<repository_name>/wiki```
  - Click New Page button
  - Edit page (add some dummy title and text)
  - Click Save page
- Clone the Wiki page project to your local drive:
  - Open the command line and go to the folder where your IDE stores your project folders (e.g.: C:\Users\myName\AndroidStudioProjects)
  - Enter command: ```git clone https://github.com/<user_name>/<repository_name>.wiki.git```
    (you can also find the clone url on the bottom right of the github Wiki pages)
  - This will create a local repository and folder: ../<repository_name>.wiki (next to your project folder)

### Manually Publishing Wiki pages
* Now remove all the wiki pages in the cloned wiki project, because some might no longer exist.
* Copy the generated wiki files to the cloned wiki project.
* Commit the local wiki project to GitHub:
  - Open the command Line
  - Go into the ../<project_name>.wiki folder (next to your project folder)
  - Enter commands:
    - ```git add .```
    - ```git commit -m "Generated by documentation_builder"```
    - ```git push```
  - A pop up page may appear for authorization

### Automatically Publishing Wiki pages
Most of the steps above could be automated with help of GitHub workflow script that is executed every time the generated files of a project are pushed:
On a remote server the script will:
* Clone the wiki page project
* Remove all wiki page files in the wiki page project
* Copy the generated files to the wiki pages project
* Git add, commit and push the wiki pages project
