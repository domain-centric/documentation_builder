These commands are cumbersome.

You can therefore also create a tools folder in the root of your project and add the following 'generate_markdown_files.dart' file in this folder.
You can now run these commands by running the 'generate_markdown_files.dart' file from your favourite IDE.

{importDartCode path:'tools/generate_markdown_files.dart'}
