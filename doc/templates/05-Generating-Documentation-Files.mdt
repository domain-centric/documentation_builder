{importDartDoc path='lib/builders/documentation_builder.dart|DocumentationBuilder.run'}

These commands are cumbersome.

You can therefore also create a tools folder in the root of your project and add the following 'generate_markdown_files.dart' file in this folder.

{ImportDartCode path='tools/generate_markdown_files.dart'}

You can now run these commands by running the 'generate_markdown_files.dart' file from your favourite IDE.
