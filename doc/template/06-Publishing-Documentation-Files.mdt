You need to publish the [GeneratedMarkdownFile]s to make them available for reading on web pages.
The following paragraphs will explain how.

## Publishing none Wiki pages
[MarkDownFile]s that are not [WikiFile]s are published:
- on https://github.com: by committing and pushing the files to [GitHub](https://github.com) using ```git commit``` and ```git push``` commands
- on https://pub.dev: by publishing your project to [PubDev](https://pub.dev) using ```dart pub publish``` or ```flutter pub publish``` commands

## Cloning Wiki pages
Before you can publish the Wiki files to [GitHub](https://github.com), you must first clone the Wiki pages into your local project. You only have to do this the first time:
- Create a Wiki page on your github project:
  - Open in browser: ```https://github.com/<user_name>/<repository_name>/wiki```
  - Click New Page button
  - Edit page (add some dummy title and text)
  - Click Save page
- Clone the Wiki pages in your local project
  - Open the command line and go to your project (e.g.: C:\Users\myName\AndroidStudioProjects\my_project)
  - Go into the doc directory (this directory was already created when making the template files)
  - Enter command: ```git clone https://github.com/<user_name>/<repository_name>.wiki.git```
    (you can also find the clone url on the bottom right of the github Wiki pages)

You can now generate the documentation files (see...). The Wiki pages will be stored in the doc/<>project_name>.wiki directory.

## Publishing Wiki pages
You can push newly generated Wiki pages to GitHub:
  - Open the command Line
  - Go into the doc/<project_name>.wiki directory
  - Enter commands:
    - ```git add .```
    - ```git commit -m "Generated on:<date time>"```
    - ```git push (a pop up page may appear for authorisation)```
